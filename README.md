You just hired an extremely capable and eager software developer to help you build your product(s). Would you throw them into your codebase without any onboarding or orientation and expect them to be able to be productive from day one? Of course not!

AI coding agentsâ€”just like their human counterpartsâ€”need 2 things in order to go from "intern" to "rockstar":

- A great manager
- A solid process

This is [Agent OS](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os). It's your playbook and operating process designed to ensure your AI coding agents can actually super-charge your product development without making a mess of things.

Adapt it how you build. Use it ship your best products more efficiently than ever.

## Created by Brian Casel @ [Builder Methods](https://buildermethods.com).

That's me, HiðŸ‘‹. I teach and coach developers and teams on the new way of building software using AI. If you're a professional who wants to stay ontop of building with AI without the hype, I got you:

# Goals

The goals of Agent OS are:

- To make your coding agents more effective and reduce mistakes!
- To simplify your development process and eliminate circular prompting and re-dos.
- Help your agents adapt to **your way** of building. Your stack. Your style.
- Works for new products and established codebases alike!
- Works with any IDE or coding environment.

_On that last point â€” I happen to use a combination of Cursor and Claude Code so the instructions below tend to focus on these environments. But you can easily adapt Agent OS to power your process in any environment._

# Agentic development workflow

Let's understand the high-level concepts behind Agent OS. It implements the following workflow for you, your team, and your agents to use.

Think of your agent as if they're a new team memberâ€”a junior developerâ€”who has joined your team to work on your software product(s). You're their manager and it's your job to make your agent as successful and productive in their new role as possible.

So to do that, you're rolling with Agent OS. Here's what it looks like:

## 1. Your Standards

Before your agent can even start working on your product, they need an orientation to _"how we do things here"_. They need to understand your standards and expectations when it comes to your development process. This can include:

- Your go-to tech stack
- Your code style preferences
- Your development best practices

Your standards are yours! I bet yours look very different than mine! And I bet they're... a lot. From your database choices, to your preferred frameworks and components libraries, to your development philosophies, even your weird code style preferences (_ask me about my multi-line Tailwind CSS style_ ðŸ˜‰). You want everyone on your team (humans and agents alike) to adhere to _your standards_.

Agent OS gives you your "standards" folder. Install your standards where your system-level memories/rules are stored so that they can be referred to and applied on _all_ product(s) codebases that you and your team will work on. Now customize, adapt, and make your standards _yours_.

## 2. Your Product

Now that your new team member has the gist of how you do things here, next they need to be introduced to the product they will be working on (i.e. your codebase).

They'll need to understand:

- The product's mission, purpose, vision, and value proposition (i.e. _what are we building and why?_)
- Your product's tech stack (does it differ in any way from your _usual_ tech stack?)
- Your product's roadmap and where we are on it.
- How your product's history may have changed and the key decisions that happened along the way.

Agent OS will install a "product" folder in your codebase that answers all of those questions in great detail.

> Note: You can use Agent OS to plan a new product _or_ install Agent OS into an existing product's codebase.

## 3. Managing Projects

Your team member is ready to work on their first project!

A project might be one big feature in your product's roadmap. Or a redesign or change in your product. Or a refactoring. Or a bug fix. Projects take all shapes and sizes, but think of them on the bigger side. A human team member might work on a project for a week or several weeks. An agent team member? A day or two (or quicker, once you have things dialed in).

Each project begins with a Project Requirements Document (PRD) which lays out the goals and scope of the project. In addition, most projects include technical specifications.

Every project includes a tasks list. This is a list of specific, executable tasks, carefully ordered in a way that takes all dependencies into account. Each task is broken into sub-tasks. Tasks are tracked and checked off as progress is made on the project.

Yepâ€”Agents work on projects and tasks the same way humans do. No re-inventing the wheel here!

## 4. Executing Tasks

The project is set and its tasks are queued. Your

# Installation

At a high level, the installation process goes like this:

1. Copy the `standards` folder onto your system where you store User rules.
2. Copy the the files in the `instructions` into your project where you store rules.
3. Plan a new product (or install into an existing codebase) using the `plan-product.md` instruction.
