You just hired an extremely capable and eager software developer to help you build your product(s). Would you throw them into your codebase without any onboarding or orientation and expect them to be able to be productive from day one? Of course not!

AI coding agentsâ€”just like their human counterpartsâ€”need 2 things in order to go from "intern" to "rockstar":

- A great manager
- A solid process

This is [Agent OS](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os). It's your playbook and operating process designed to ensure your AI coding agents can actually super-charge your product development without making a mess of things.

Adapt it how you build. Use it ship your best products more efficiently than ever.

## Created by Brian Casel @ [Builder Methods](https://buildermethods.com).

That's me, HiðŸ‘‹. I teach and coach developers and teams on the new way of building software using AI. If you're a professional who wants to stay ontop of building with AI without the hype, I got you:

# Goals

Agent OS helps you:

- Make your coding agents more effective and reduce mistakes
- Eliminate circular prompting and endless re-dos  
- Get agents working **your way** - your stack, your style
- Works with new products and existing codebases alike

_I use Cursor + Claude Code, so examples focus on those environments. But you can adapt Agent OS anywhere._

# Agentic development workflow

Think of your agent as a junior developer joining your team. You're their manager, and it's your job to make them as productive as possible.

Here's how Agent OS works:

## 1. Your Standards

Before your agent touches code, they need to know _"how we do things here"_:

- Your tech stack
- Your code style preferences  
- Your development best practices

Your standards are yours! From database choices to framework preferences to weird code style quirks (_ask me about my multi-line Tailwind CSS style_ ðŸ˜‰). You want everyoneâ€”humans and agents alikeâ€”following _your standards_.

Agent OS gives you a "standards" folder that gets applied across all your projects. Install it where your system-level memories live, then customize it to match your way of working.

## 2. Your Product

Now your agent needs to understand the product they're working on:

- Mission, purpose, and value proposition (_what are we building and why?_)
- Product-specific tech stack choices
- Current roadmap and progress
- Key decisions and product history

Agent OS installs a "product" folder in your codebase with all these details.

> Note: Works for new products or existing codebases.

## 3. Managing Projects

Time for your agent's first project! Projects are the bigger stuffâ€”new features, redesigns, refactoring, major bug fixes. Humans might spend weeks on a project; agents can knock them out in a day or two.

Each project starts with a Project Requirements Document (PRD) covering goals and scope, plus technical specifications.

Every project includes a task listâ€”specific, executable tasks in dependency order, broken into sub-tasks. Progress gets tracked as tasks are completed.

Yepâ€”agents work on projects just like humans do. No reinventing the wheel here!

## 4. Executing Tasks

Project planned, tasks queued. Time for your agent to work!

With all that context loaded up front, your agent can tackle big tasks (maybe several at once) in one shot, with minimal revisions or re-dos needed.

Front-loading the details = incredibly high success rates.

## 5. Refinement

No team has perfect chemistry from day oneâ€”same goes for managing agents!

You'll learn something with every project. A missed detail. An implementation you'd do differently. A rabbit hole that wasn't needed.

Refining your Agent OS is ongoing. The more you refine, the better your agents perform, and the more predictable your whole agentic development team becomes!
