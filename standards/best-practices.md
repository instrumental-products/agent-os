# Best practices

Our best practices in regards to code development, codebase management and development strategy.

Always adhere to these best practices when developing new code or maintaining existing logic in our codebase:

## Keep it simple

Always implement code in simplest/fewest lines possible.

## Optimize for readability

Optimize for readability and maintainability over performance. While we always want our application and codebase to be performant and use any/all best performance best practices, we care more about ensuring our codebase is easy to read, easy to maintain and iterate.

## DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

Use DRY principles and extract repeated code.

- Extract repeated business logic to private methods.
- Extract repeated front-end markup to partials.

## Choose libraries wisely

- When pulling in 3rd party libraries or gems, always choose the library or gem that is most popular and most recently actively maintained. View the library or gem's github repository to determine popularity and freshness.
